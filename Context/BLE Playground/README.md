## Key Features

<img src="./README-ref/ble-playground-sample-ui.gif" alt="ble-template" width="500" />

### Device Discovery

The application uses BLE scanning to find compatible devices within range. This feature is powered by the `BleServiceHandler.ts` script and allows filtering by device name or service UUID.

```typescript
// Example: Start scanning for devices
bleServiceHandler.onStartScan();
```

### Smart Light Control

Control Hue smart lights including power, brightness, and color settings. This feature is handled by the `HueLightController.ts` script.

```typescript
// Example: Toggle light power
hueLightController.togglePower(true);

// Example: Set light color
hueLightController.setColor(new vec4(1, 0, 0, 1)); // Red
```

<img src="./README-ref/ble-playground-sample-heartrate.gif" alt="heart-rate" width="500" />

### Heart Rate Monitoring

Connect to and read data from heart rate monitor devices like Polar H10. This feature is handled by the `HeartRateController.ts` script.

```typescript
// Heart rate data will be processed automatically via notifications
// and displayed in the connected text component
```

### Debug Mode

Test BLE functionality in the editor without actual hardware. This is particularly useful during development and is configured through the `LensInitializer.ts` script.

## Key Scripts

### BleServiceHandler.ts

This script handles:

- Scanning for BLE devices
- Managing device connections
- Processing scan results
- Dispatching events for discovered devices

### HueLightController.ts

This script handles:

- Connecting to Hue light devices
- Controlling light power, brightness, and color
- Managing GATT services and characteristics for lights
- Processing notifications from the light device

### HeartRateController.ts

## Developer Resources

### GATT Specification

The Bluetooth GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) specification defines how BLE devices exchange data using services, characteristics, and descriptors. For detailed information, refer to the official specification supplement:

- [GATT Specification Supplement](https://btprodspecificationrefs.blob.core.windows.net/gatt-specification-supplement/GATT_Specification_Supplement.pdf) (Version Date: 2025-01-15)

This document contains the definitions for all GATT characteristics and characteristic descriptors, which is essential for understanding and implementing BLE communication.

### Gotchas

When working with BLE in this template, keep these common issues in mind:

- **Promise Handling**: Use try/catch, then() and finally() for proper error handling with promises
- **Device Verification**: Check device name, UUIDs, and properties using tools like nRFConnect before implementation
- **Scan Results**: `startScan()` will return a result object if successful, not just a boolean
- **UUID Comparison**: When comparing UUIDs, remember that `UuidCompare` is checking for substring inclusion, not exact matching

### Notes

**Heart Rate Monitors:**
- Use a dedicated app for initial setup of the heart rate monitor
- Avoid connecting with a second app while using this template
- The monitor will only pair with one device at a time

### API Tips

- You can use `await` or promise chaining (`.then()`) - both approaches work
- For lengthy operations, consider using non-blocking calls
- Register notification handlers before writing to characteristics when possible

## Testing the Lens

### In Lens Studio Editor

1. Open the Preview panel in Lens Studio.
2. Enable debug mode in `LensInitializer.ts` by setting `isNoBleDebug = true`.
3. Test the UI and interaction flow without requiring actual BLE devices.

### On Spectacles Device

1. Build and deploy the project to your Spectacles device.
2. Follow the [Spectacles guide](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/get-started/start-building/preview-panel) for device testing.

## Device Debugging Tips

### Connect to Hue Light 
Light must be on to connect. If you previously paired with your phone (eg, via nRF Connect or the Hue app), you must reset your bulb to connect to Spectacles. Ble will only auto connect to your bulb if it is named "Hue color lamp" (default name).  You can connect manually by tapping scan result. 

### Reset Hue Light 
If you are having trouble writing to hue bulb, you can try resetting bulb via Power Cycling:
- Power off: Turn off the power to the bulb for 10 seconds (either at the wall switch or by unplugging the lamp).
- Power on: Turn the power back on and leave it on for 3 seconds. 
- Power off: Turn the power off again for 10 seconds. 
- Repeat: Repeat the on and off cycle until the bulb flashes, with each on period lasting 3 seconds and each off period lasting 10 seconds. 
- Confirm reset: The bulb should blink or cycle colors to indicate a successful reset. 

### Connect to Polar Chest Band 
- Download Polar Flow app
- Connect battery to strap
- Place strap around chest with skin contact.  Now your device is advertising -- but only to the mobile app
- In mobile app:
  - Select the “...” in the lower right corner
  - Select Devices
  - If your polar band is on and battery is full, it should appear
  - Select Connect 
  - In the next screen, make sure all four fields are selected, including “2 Bluetooth devices”.  This enables your band to be connected to your phone and spectacles at the same time. 
If you’re still having trouble connecting, you may need to [reset your device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFvB8MUy9Z4)
