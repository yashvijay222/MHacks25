## Overview

This project showcases a real-time collaborative AR experience where two users adjust a shared numeric value and RGB sliders to control the color of an object in the scene. The system synchronizes all interactions across devices, ensuring seamless collaboration.
This lens leverages the [Spectacles Interaction Kit (SIK)](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/spectacles-frameworks/spectacles-interaction-kit/get-started) to simplify UI development for Spectacles and demonstrates the potential of [Connected Lenses](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/about-spectacles-features/connected-lenses/overview) for creating engaging, synchronized AR experiences.

> **NOTE:**
> This project will only work for the Spectacles platform.

## Testing the Lens

### In Lens Studio Editor

1. Open the Lens in Lens Studio and create two Interactive Previews using the [Interactive Preview Panel](https://developers.snap.com/lens-studio/lens-studio-workflow/previewing-your-lens#interactive-preview)
2. Click the Multiplayer button for both previews. They will connect to the same session and map surroundings automatically.
3. Test functionality:
   - Adjust the shared numeric value using the "∧" and "v" buttons in one preview and ensure the change reflects instantly in the second preview.
   - Modify the RGB sliders in one preview and confirm the floating object's color updates in both previews in real-time.

### In Spectacles Device

1. Connect two pairs of Spectacles to the same session following the [Playing Connected Lenses Guide](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/about-spectacles-features/connected-lenses/overview#playing-connected-lenses-on-spectacles).
2. Test functionality:
   - Adjust the shared numeric value on one device and confirm it updates on the other.
   - Use the RGB sliders on one device and ensure the color of the floating object updates in real-time on both devices.
