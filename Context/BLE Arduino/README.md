## Overview

This example shows an Arduino board with an IMU sending euler angles from Arduino to Spectacles via BLE.

> **NOTE:**
> This project will only work for the Spectacles platform and Lens Studio.

## Design Guidelines

Designing Lenses for Spectacles offers all-new possibilities to rethink user interaction with digital spaces and the physical world.
Get started using our [Design Guidelines](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/best-practices/design-for-spectacles/introduction-to-spatial-design)

## Prerequisites

- **Lens Studio**: v5.10.0+
- **Spectacles OS Version**: v5.62+
- **Spectacles App iOS**: v0.62+
- **Spectacles App Android**: v0.62+

To update your Spectacles device and mobile app, please refer to this [guide](https://support.spectacles.com/hc/en-us/articles/30214953982740-Updating).

You can download the latest version of Lens Studio from [here](https://ar.snap.com/download?lang=en-US).

## Getting Started

To obtain the project folder, clone the repository.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> This project uses Git Large Files Support (LFS). Downloading a zip file using the green button on GitHub **will not work**. You must clone the project with a version of git that has LFS.
> You can download Git LFS [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Initial Project Setup

1.) Download and install the latest <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/">Arduino IDE</a>.

2.) Install esp32 by Espressif Systems from the <a href="https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360016119519-Add-boards-to-Arduino-IDE">board manager</a>.

3.) Install MPU6050_light.h by rfetick from the <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries/">libraries manager</a>.

4.) Choose board Esp32 -> Node32s

5.) Choose port /dev/cu.usbserial-0001

6.) <a href="https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4733418441116-Upload-a-sketch-in-Arduino-IDE">Upload</a> the Arduino code!

## Testing the Lens

> **IMPORTANT:**
> The BLE API does not support editor testing at this time.

### On Spectacles Device

[Extended Permissions](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/permission-privacy/extended-permissions) mode must be enabled because this lens uses the experimental BLE API.

1. Build and deploy the project to your Spectacles device.
2. Follow the [Spectacles guide](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/get-started/start-building/preview-panel) for device testing.
