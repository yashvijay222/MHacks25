## Overview
This project uses SnapML to detect chess pieces and provide move suggestions using AI. It demonstrates how Spectacles can enhance real-world activities through computer vision and intelligent assistance.

> **NOTE**:
> This project will only work for the Spectacles platform.

## Prerequisites

- **Lens Studio**: v5.10.0+
- **Spectacles OS Version**: v5.62+
- **Spectacles App iOS**: v0.62+
- **Spectacles App Android**: v0.62+
- **1 Standard Physical Chess Board**
    - With all pieces

To update your Spectacles device and mobile app, please refer to this [guide](https://support.spectacles.com/hc/en-us/articles/30214953982740-Updating).

You can download the latest version of Lens Studio from [here](https://ar.snap.com/download?lang=en-US).

The camera feature requires you to use Experimental APIs. Please see Experimental APIs for more details [here](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/about-spectacles-features/apis/experimental-apis).

Extended Permissions mode on device must be enabled for enabling some of the Spectacles APIs. Please see Extended Permissions for more details [here](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/permission-privacy/extended-permissions).

## Getting Started

To obtain the project folder, clone the repository.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> This project uses Git Large Files Support (LFS). Downloading a zip file using the green button on GitHub **will not work**. You must clone the project with a version of git that has LFS.
> You can download Git LFS [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Initial Project Setup

This project requires an API token to function properly:

1. Generate an API Token:
    * In Lens Studio, navigate to the Asset Library
    * Install the "Remote Service Gateway Token Generator"
    * Use the generator to create a new public API token
2. Apply the Token:
    * Find the RemoteServiceGatewayCredentials object in the Scene Hierarchy
    * Apply your newly generated token to this object
    * Ensure the token is properly saved before testing

> **Note:**
> The API token is essential for the chess AI functionality to connect with external services that provide move suggestions.

## Key Scripts

Camera (CameraService.ts)
* Gets frames from the device camera (Spectacles Left Camera)
* Creates a Pinhole Camera Model to represent intrinsics and transforms
* Crops a square area from camera frames for ML processing

ML Model (MLController.ts)
* Uses 512x512 YoloV7-tiny model converted to ONNX
* Handles 12 output classes (6 piece types × 2 colors)
* Configurable Confidence and Intersection Over Union (IOU) thresholds via script sliders
* Runs intermittently to conserve power

Detection Processing (ChessBoardPredictor.ts)
* Determines player position (white side) using center of mass for white detections
* Post-processes piece detections based on board position
* Caches recent board positions to filter noise
* Converts 2D board positions to 3D using user-defined reference plane

Chess AI (ChessAI.ts)
* Converts piece positions to Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN)
* Validates FEN strings to ensure valid board setups
* Integrates with Google's Gemini API for move suggestions
* Alternative StockFish-based API option with configurable depth
* Converts algebraic notation back to real-world coordinates

### In Lens Studio Editor

When working with this project in Lens Studio:

* A virtual chess board will be generated in the scene
* For best results, disable simulation in the Preview Panel to prevent visual misalignment
* Individual chess pieces cannot be manually moved, but you can shuffle piece placement
* Use your mouse to interact with the hint button to test the AI suggestion functionality 

### On Spectacles Device

To use this Lens with a physical chess board:

1. Board Detection: Position your Spectacles to view a complete chess board
2. Calibration Process:
    * Once detected, you'll need to place two calibration pins
    * Position the first pin (labeled "L") at the left corner closest to your color pieces
    * Next, place the second pin (labeled "R") at the right side of the board

3. Getting Hints:
    * After successful calibration, a hint button will appear in front of your chess board
    * Press this button with your finger to request AI-powered move suggestions
    * The system will analyze the current board state and display recommended moves

4. Recalibrate:
    * Look at your left palm and pinch to recalibrate the chess board.
