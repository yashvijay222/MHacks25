## Initial Project Setup

The project should be pre-configured to get you started without any additional steps. However, if you encounter issues in the Logger Panel, please ensure your Lens Studio environment is set up for [Spectacles](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/get-started/start-buiding/preview-panel).

## Key Script

[AreaManager.ts](./Assets/TemplateCode/AreaManager.ts) - This is the primary script that integrates different behaviours with the UI.
[AnchorManager.ts](./Assets/TemplateCode/SpatialPersistence/AnchorManager.ts) - Primary script for managing the anchor behaviours
[TextInputManager](./Assets/TemplateCode/TextInputManager.ts) - Primary script for handling keyboard input

## Testing the Lens

### In Lens Studio Editor

In the [Interactive Preview Panel](https://developers.snap.com/lens-studio/lens-studio-workflow/previewing-your-lens#interactive-preview). Click on the **New Area** button in the area selection menu with the left mouse button. A panel will then show up where user can drag different post-it notes to the scene. Click on the **Main Menu** to go back to the area selection menu.

### In Spectacles Device

To install your Lens on your device, refer to the guide provided [here](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/get-started/start-buiding/test-lens-on-spectacles).

After successfully installing the Lens, Select the **New Area** button with the pinch gesture. The localization process should begin with a prompt text appeared informing the user to look around. After the localization completes, a panel will then show up where user can drag different post-it notes to the scene. Click on the **Main Menu** to go back to the area selection menu.

#### Spatial Persistence

Exit the lens and open it again. If the same area is selected, the previously created notes will spawn in the same position in the space.

#### Recovery Mode

When it fails to locate the previously mapped area, the recovery mode will be activated. The lens will restore the post-it notes in front of the user with the same relative positions. The user will be able to adjust the anchor point of the notes and press the save button to update the mapping.
