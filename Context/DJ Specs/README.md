<img src="./README-ref/sample-list-dj-specs-rounded-edges.gif" alt="dj-specs" width="500" />

A comprehensive **Snapchat Lens** project featuring an interactive DJ turntable experience with realistic vinyl physics, multi-track audio mixing, and hand tracking optimized for **Spectacles**.

## Overview

This repository contains a modern DJ mixing experience built with Lens Studio 5.x and optimized specifically for Spectacles with advanced hand tracking capabilities.

> **NOTE:**
> This project requires Spectacles hardware for full hand tracking functionality and demonstrates advanced spatial AR development.

> **NOTE:**
> This project is currently developed in Javascript, will be provided a Typescript variant in the future. As many developers asked us to enhance our audio experience with features like Playback Speed, we thought this was a fun way to fill the gap until then. 

## Design Guidelines

Designing Lenses for Spectacles offers all-new possibilities to rethink user interaction with digital spaces and the physical world.
Get started using our [Design Guidelines](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/best-practices/design-for-spectacles/introduction-to-spatial-design)

## Prerequisites

- **Lens Studio**: v5.10.0+
- **Spectacles OS Version**: v5.62+
- **Spectacles App iOS**: v0.62+
- **Spectacles App Android**: v0.62+

To update your Spectacles device and mobile app, please refer to this [guide](https://support.spectacles.com/hc/en-us/articles/30214953982740-Updating).

You can download the latest version of Lens Studio from [here](https://ar.snap.com/download?lang=en-US).

The hand tracking features require you to use Experimental APIs. Please see Experimental APIs for more details [here](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/about-spectacles-features/apis/experimental-apis).

Extended Permissions mode on device must be enabled for enabling some of the Spectacles APIs. Please see Extended Permissions for more details [here](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/permission-privacy/extended-permissions).

## Getting Started

To obtain the project folder, clone the repository.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> This project uses Git Large Files Support (LFS). Downloading a zip file using the green button on GitHub **will not work**. You must clone the project with a version of git that has LFS.
> You can download Git LFS [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Initial Project Setup

The project should be pre-configured to get you started without any additional steps. However, ensure you:

1. Open the project file: `DJSpecs.esproj` in Lens Studio 5.10+

2. Verify audio assets are properly loaded in `Assets/Audio/`

3. Check that all script dependencies are resolved in the project.

Failure to properly load audio assets will result in silent playback when testing the DJ functionality.

```javascript
class VinylInertia {
    // Simulates realistic vinyl physics with:
    // - Decay time constants for realistic slowdown
    // - Momentum-based rotation
    // - Friction simulation
    constructor(decayTimeConstSec) {
        this.decayTimeConstSec = decayTimeConstSec;
        this.decay = -2.30258 / decayTimeConstSec; // -ln(0.1)
        this.playbackRate = 0.0;
        this.timePassed = 100.0;
    }
}
```

#### Audio Controller
Located in: `Assets/Scene/Scripts/AudioController.js`

## Script Architecture

### Core Script Files

#### Audio Processing
```javascript
// AudioController.js - Main audio processing engine
class AudioController {
    setSpeed(value)      // Adjust playback speed
    pause()              // Pause audio playback
    resume()             // Resume audio playback
    setDirection(dir)    // Set forward/reverse playback
    setPitch(pitch)      // Adjust audio pitch
}
```

#### Interaction Systems
```javascript
// VinylRotator.js - Physics-based vinyl simulation
class VinylInertia {
    getPlaybackRate(currentTime)    // Calculate current playback rate
    setPlaybackRate(rate)           // Set new playback rate with inertia
}

// HandController.js - Hand tracking for Spectacles
function getRotationDirection(handPosition)  // Calculate rotation from hand movement
function getTouchMoveSpeed(handPosition)     // Calculate movement speed
```

### Animation Framework
The project uses a modular tween system for smooth animations:

```javascript
// TweenManager.js - Central animation system
TweenManager.startTween(object, property, target, duration, easing)
TweenManager.stopTween(tweenId)
TweenManager.pauseAllTweens()
```
