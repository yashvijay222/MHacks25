## Overview
This project uses SnapML to detect a pool table with all 16 balls and pocket holes. 

> **NOTE**:
> This project will only work for the Spectacles platform.

## Prerequisites

- **Lens Studio**: v5.10.0+
- **Spectacles OS Version**: v5.62+
- **Spectacles App iOS**: v0.62+
- **Spectacles App Android**: v0.62+
- **1 Standard Pool Table**
    - With all pieces

To update your Spectacles device and mobile app, please refer to this [guide](https://support.spectacles.com/hc/en-us/articles/30214953982740-Updating).

You can download the latest version of Lens Studio from [here](https://ar.snap.com/download?lang=en-US).

The camera feature requires you to use Experimental APIs. Please see Experimental APIs for more details [here](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/about-spectacles-features/apis/experimental-apis).

Extended Permissions mode on device must be enabled for enabling some of the Spectacles APIs. Please see Extended Permissions for more details [here](https://developers.snap.com/spectacles/permission-privacy/extended-permissions).

## Getting Started

To obtain the project folder, clone the repository.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> This project uses Git Large Files Support (LFS). Downloading a zip file using the green button on GitHub **will not work**. You must clone the project with a version of git that has LFS.
> You can download Git LFS [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Key Scripts

Camera (CameraService.ts)
* Gets frames from the device camera (Spectacles Left Camera)
* Creates a Pinhole Camera Model to represent intrinsics and transforms
* Crops a square area from camera frames for ML processing

ML Model (MLController.ts)
* Uses 512x512 YoloV7-tiny model converted to ONNX
* Handles 17 output classes (0: cue ball, 1-15: pool balls, 16: pockets)
* Configurable Confidence and Intersection Over Union (IOU) thresholds via script sliders

Parsing Detections (PoolTablePredictor.ts)
* Guides player to align the table surface using two markers
* Un-projects bounding box detections to 3D positions using the user-defined reference plane

Tracking Detections (MultiObjectTracking.ts)
* Tracks pool ball positions over time using a spatial-temporal algorithm
* Matches tracklets to maintain consistent object identification

Simulated Pool Table (SimulatedPoolTable.ts)
* Provides a virtual table with physics for Editor debugging
* Includes random impulse forces to simulate ball movement around the table

### In Lens Studio Editor

When working with this project in Lens Studio:

* A virtual pool table will be generated in the scene
* For best results, disable simulation in the Preview Panel to prevent visual misalignment
* You can shuffle the balls that are in the pool table by using your mouse on the Preview Panel

### On Spectacles Device

To use this Lens with a physical pool table:

1. Pool Table Detection: Position your Spectacles to view a complete pool table

2. Calibration Process:
    * Once detected, you'll need to place two calibration pins
    * Position the first pin (labeled "L") at the bottom left corner pocket, ensuring it touches the felt of the table
    * Next, place the second pin (labeled "R") at the bottom right corner pocket of the pool table

3. After Calibration:
    * After successful calibration, Spectacles will track all the viewable balls in the pool table in real time. 

4. Recalibrate:
    * Look at your left palm and pinch to recalibrate the pool table.
